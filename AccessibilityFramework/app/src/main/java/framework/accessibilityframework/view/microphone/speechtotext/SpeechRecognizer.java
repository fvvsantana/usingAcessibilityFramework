/**
 * This class is responsible for displaying the mic symbol and recognizing the user's speech, which is
 * transformed into text and saved in an arraylist, which is a private attribute of the class.
 * There is a getter method in order to retrieve the text sentences externally.
 * This class functionality is NOT intended to be executed as a service, since its continuous use drains the device battery and
 * demands considerable bandwidth (the recognition is done online).
 * The recognition intent might ALWAYS be executed in the main thread of the application, or the Android framework will
 * throw an exception.
 * The recognized language is attribute of the class
