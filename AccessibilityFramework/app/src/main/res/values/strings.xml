    <string name="intro_msg">Hello. Welcome to the Android Client Module. This module is intended to help you to create mobile applications that use the built-in hardwares
    of your mobile phone, such as the camera, microphone and sensors. You can start understanding the module by picking one of our sample examples bellow.</string>

    <string name="linear_acceleration">Linear Acceleration </string>
    <string name="linear_acceleration_desc">The linear acceleration sensor provides you with a three-dimensional vector representing acceleration along each device axis,
        excluding gravity. You typically use this sensor when you want to obtain acceleration data without the influence of gravity. For example, you could use this sensor to
        see how fast your car is going. The linear acceleration sensor always has an offset, which you need to remove by calibrating the device when it is resting on a table.
